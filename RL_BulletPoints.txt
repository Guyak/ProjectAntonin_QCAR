Simulink simulation setup :
- In bicycle kinematics simulink model : use "Plant Model" bloc to model QCar with bicycle representation
- Create an environment the type of complexMap.mat => boolean matrix with ones representing obstacles
- Replace "Planner" function with an RL DDPG agent to pilot the QCar model
- Remove all "Control" block except "Zero-Velocity At Goal" subsystem (will need to be modified) to really learn without a clear goal

RL Agent :
- Determine reward function (on C334 middle board)
- Use watertank NN ?
- Determine number of episodes and length

Training :
- If an episode ends with a collision => respawn to a random startLoc (one of the map value that equals to 0)
- Else => Start next episode at the previous ending position
